				<h4>WWII Silver Thruppence "Three Reigns" Sweetheart Bracelet</h4>
				<p>British soldiers who were stationed overseas during WWII used to make these 
				   "sweetheart bracelets" to send to their significant others back home. This 
				   particular example is made from nine .925 silver 3-pence coins, dated 1882, 
				   1889, 1898, 1902, 1912, 1913, 1936, 1940 and 1941.
